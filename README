This is a temporary repository with some review tools for the Ubuntu One
projects.

review-notifier <project1> [[project2] ...]

This tool will present notifications for changes to merge proposals on a
project. You currently must pass the list of projects on the command line.


review-list <project1> [[project2] ...]

This tool will present a list of all the branches currently in the
Needs Review state. It includes the current list of Ubuntu One projects to
monitor, and additional projects can be passed in on the command line.


Both tools use launchpadlib, and refresh automatically every 5 minutes
as a hardcoded value. The former is not particularly useful with the new
review-list script, but I've included it here for completeness.
