This is a temporary repository with some review tools for projects on
Launchpad.

review-notifier <project1> [[project2] ...]

This tool will present notifications for changes to merge proposals on a
project. You currently must pass the list of projects on the command line.


review-list <project1> [[project2] ...]

This tool will present a list of all the branches currently in the
Needs Review state. The list includes the branch name, and the votes
on the proposal. You can double-click on a row to open the merge
proposal page in your browser.


Both tools use launchpadlib, and refresh automatically every 5 minutes
as a hardcoded value. The former is not particularly useful with the new
review-list script, but I've included it here for completeness.
